The study use history data of each dairy cow from 2018 to 2019, which are 95 dairy cows in the cold season (NTU farm:23、HJ farm:72), 109 in the warm season (NTU farm:25、HJ farm:84), and 84 in the hot season (NTU farm:9、HJ farm:75), some data was discarded due to include missing value. Finally 16121 sets of data were included in the SVR(Support Vector Machine) algorithm prediction model established in this study. According to dairy cow twice a day can be predicted by the SVR model established by this study with enter the daily activity and environmental heat stress in the past feature parameter, the farmer can identify abnormal status rapidly and make a decision about the nursing work to improve production and the health of dairy cows. SVR predicted model proposed by the study can provide lots of help on Intelligent farm management in the future.

Due to the rapid development of smart devices and the continuous investment of leading communities, the corresponding technologies have been developed and adopted like never before. In the field of IoT display devices (client displays, touch screens, etc.) , This study observes and shows that IoT contains hidden information that is difficult to display, inaccessibility, invisibility, etc. Among them, electronic paper (ePaper) is a portable storage and display medium, and the display content can be repeatedly refreshed by an electronic device, and the electronic paper needs to use a power source when the display content changes. Based on some attractive characteristics and potential benefits of ePaper-based innovative industrial applications, it is necessary to give an analysis to point out some key points from practical viewpoints. We reviewed and studied previously proposed research and applications, we proposed 12 industrial domains for analyzing the contribution of ePaper-based innovative industrial applications. Furthermore, we elaborate on 6 application characteristics of ePaper to develop a mapping matrix for industrial domains. This mapping matrix can provide some hints and implications about current key innovative applications and some potential ones based on ePaper in various industries. In the tablet-based innovative applications, it might be a challenge and concerns to replace electronic Tablets with ePaper-based ones just for green applications. Hence, we further discussed and compared ePaper tablets with electronic ones in terms of 6 technical and practical features. Finally, we gave 3 cases including medical applications to high light the contribution and benefits of ePaper-based applications in terms of cost-effective, innovation, and usability. We also gave some evaluation methods and suggestions for ePaper stakeholders to apply ePaper technology in their innovative applications.
