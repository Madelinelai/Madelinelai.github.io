[{"categories":["fingernails"],"contents":"聊天機器人(Chatbot)，透過AI(人工智慧)的方式，電腦程式模擬與使用者互動的對話，在獲得用戶資訊的互動過程中發揮有效率的作用，因為近年來即時通訊軟體的使用頻率更高，讓企業對聊天機器人(chatbot)需求高速成長。 本篇文章說明指甲研究室_Linebot開發的過程，由已發表的文獻內容作為主題發想，挑戰在有限的一星期內進行具有影像判識模型的對話機器人，讓開發不再是冗長費心且耗費鉅資。有興趣的人歡迎透過下方QRcode進入，加入好友後即可體驗～指甲帶給您的隱藏訊息。 1. 主題發想參考fingernails文獻(Lee, S.H., Yang, C.S., “Fingernail analysis management system using microscopy sensor and blockchain technology” International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks, Vol. 14, No.3, 2018) 指甲研究室LineBot介紹 2. 主要功能說明(以圖文選單及多頁訊息搭配關鍵字觸發) 3. 透過爬蟲程式蒐集大量指甲圖像，進行分類「建康指甲」「指甲」「其它症狀」 3. 模型建立(使用Teachable Machine)，此功能可以訓練圖像、聲音、肢體三種多媒體格式。透過三個步驟即可完成訓練完畢的模型，最後將模型上傳至Google Cloud Platform (GCP)部署。最後將生成的網址填回LineBot API中的webhook URL欄位 4. 結論 持續監控LineBot中用戶的使用行為，得知用戶對於指甲資訊尚需「加入更多有關指甲的保健資訊及護理方式」「分類增加－黑甲症、黃甲症、指甲疱疹、病毒疣、指甲雞眼、指甲腫瘤」等資訊。使提供服務商即可透過Line聊天介面與客戶進行雙向的溝通，具有24小時的服務特性、減少人力成本、提升服務效率、推播商品廣告／服務資訊。 串聯更多手足保健社團及指甲教育協會使得「促進指甲健康生態圈」更龐大完整。 ","permalink":"https://Madelinelai.github.io/blog/nail/","tags":["Line_ChatBot","Machine learning","Analysis","Case"],"title":"指甲研究室LineBot對話機器人"},{"categories":["Machine learning"],"contents":"Prediction of Milk Yield of Dairy Cows based on Machine Learning The output of dairy cows will be affected by many factors, it does not only make the management of farm easier, but also assist farmers to can be controlling precisely. The study use history data of each dairy cow from 2018 to 2019, which are 95 dairy cows in the cold season (NTU farm:23、HJ farm:72), 109 in the warm season (NTU farm:25、HJ farm:84), and 84 in the hot season (NTU farm:9、HJ farm:75), some data was discarded due to include missing value. Finally 16121 sets of data were included in the SVR(Support Vector Machine) algorithm prediction model established in this study. According to dairy cow twice a day can be predicted by the SVR model established by this study with enter the daily activity and environmental heat stress in the past feature parameter, the farmer can identify abnormal status rapidly and make a decision about the nursing work to improve production and the health of dairy cows. SVR predicted model proposed by the study can provide lots of help on Intelligent farm management in the future.

Due to the rapid development of smart devices and the continuous investment of leading communities, the corresponding technologies have been developed and adopted like never before. In the field of IoT display devices (client displays, touch screens, etc.) , This study observes and shows that IoT contains hidden information that is difficult to display, inaccessibility, invisibility, etc. Among them, electronic paper (ePaper) is a portable storage and display medium, and the display content can be repeatedly refreshed by an electronic device, and the electronic paper needs to use a power source when the display content changes. Based on some attractive characteristics and potential benefits of ePaper-based innovative industrial applications, it is necessary to give an analysis to point out some key points from practical viewpoints. We reviewed and studied previously proposed research and applications, we proposed 12 industrial domains for analyzing the contribution of ePaper-based innovative industrial applications. Furthermore, we elaborate on 6 application characteristics of ePaper to develop a mapping matrix for industrial domains. This mapping matrix can provide some hints and implications about current key innovative applications and some potential ones based on ePaper in various industries. In the tablet-based innovative applications, it might be a challenge and concerns to replace electronic Tablets with ePaper-based ones just for green applications. Hence, we further discussed and compared ePaper tablets with electronic ones in terms of 6 technical and practical features. Finally, we gave 3 cases including medical applications to high light the contribution and benefits of ePaper-based applications in terms of cost-effective, innovation, and usability. We also gave some evaluation methods and suggestions for ePaper stakeholders to apply ePaper technology in their innovative applications.
